	Abstract = {{The 7B2 bio-imaging beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL)
   is newly equipped with a 3D X-ray tomography system. It can provide 3D
   X-ray images with a resolving power better than 2 mu m in a
   non-destructive way without destroying an optically opaque substance. By
   using stable, high-flux synchrotron radiation, it can photograph digital
   images with high resolution at exposure times of ms in real time. While
   it; can obtain an absorption contrast image according to the absorption
   difference of a substance, it can also obtain an image representing the
   edge-enhanced mechanism by using a small angle diffraction of
   synchrotron radiation, which takes place at the boundary surface of the
   density difference in an individual component material. The 7B2
   bio-imaging beamline has been newly setup and provides users with image
   acquisition, reconstruction, and image-rendering software for computer
   X-ray tomography. In this presentation, we will introduce the beamline
   setup, with optical instruments and imaging processing software, of the
   7B2 bio-imaging beamline.}},
