\section{Hardware}

\subsection{High-throughput architecture}

The CMOS-image sensor receives a request for the new frame in combination with the defined exposure time. When the integration time is finished, the image stored in the pixelmatrix (global shutter) is read out sequentially, row-by-row. The pixel values are then passed to a column ADC cell, which ADC conversion is performed. Then, in 10bit/pixel configuration, the digital signals are read out over 16 parallels LVDS (low voltage differential signal) channels where each LVDS channel reads out 128 adjacent columns of the array. Control registers are used for the programming of the sensor. Overview is displayed in Figure \ref{fpga-arch}.

In order to read out the CMOS sensor as fast as possible, a PCI Express interface is used to transfer the data arriving from the mother board directly to the computer embedded memory. A PCI Express x4 lane generation 2 standard, with a theoretical bandwidth of 20 Gbit/s, is used. The achieved bandwidth is only limited by the speed grade of the FPGA. Direct Memory Access (DMA) is used to transfer the data from the camera to the central system memory and vice versa.

Addressable 32-bit user bank registers are implemented in the dedicated Base Address Registers (BAR) space. Bank registers are used to write/read the status/configurations of the DMA engines, the CMOSIS chip and the FPGA logic. Unused address locations of the bank can be used by further user applications. More information about the bank registers is given in chapter[[?]. The DDR (Double Data Rate) memory device is used for both temporary frame data storage before the transferring of the data and for an on-line data elaboration.

Camera has full access of the pixel parameters in order to adapt the pixel response at any experiment condition, like adjustable image exposure time and pixel dynamic range, noise threshold, mask, analog gain, etc. Continuous data acquisition at full speed for each frame rate condition without any readout dead time is also achieved. This camera can easily be extended to any available CMOS-image sensor.


\subsection{Image sensor CMOSIS CMV2000}

The CMV2000 is a high speed CMOS image sensor with 2048 by 1088 pixels (2/3 optical inch) developed for machine vision applications. The image array consists of 5.5$\mu$m x 5.5$\mu$m pipelined global shutter pixels which allow exposure during read out, while performing CDS operation. The image sensor has sixteen 10- or 12-bit digital LVDS outputs (serial). The image sensor also integrates a programmable gain amplifier and pixel threshold. Each channel runs at 480 Mbps maximum. Higher frame rates can be achieved in row-windowing mode or row-subsampling mode. These modes are all programmable using the SPI interface. All internal exposure and read out timings are generated by a programmable on-board sequencer. External triggering and exposure programming is a sensor feature which is also implemented in the camera. Extended optical dynamic range can be achieved by using piecewise feature of the sensor.

Please look at the CMV2000 datasheet for more information regarding the sensor, and additional CMOSIS white papers regarding recommended register settings \cite{CMOSIS:CMV2000}. Also, in section \ref{camera_char} is given the overview of the sensor characterization for several different parameters.

\section{Software}

The camera software splits in three parts. Interface to the camera hardware, a general camera interface library and specific decoding modules for the supported image sensors.

\subsection{Camera driver and tools -- pcitool}

The architecture of the software layer is presented in Figure 1.3. It includes a kernel module, an PCILIB library, command-line utility and a GUI.

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{pcitool-arch} Software layer and data flow.}
\end{figure}

The kernel module is kept as small as possible. It is only responsible for de- vice configuration, interrupt counting, management of DMA buffers, and mapping of both PCI I/O space and DMA buffers into the userspace. All other functions in- cluding the actual implementation of DMA engine are realized in user space. Finally, the design of the driver allows fine grained scripting. For example, it is possible to start the DMA engine, set some registers to initiate DMA transfer, read data from DMA engine, make an attempt to process it, and if the wrong data is returned, analyze the status registers to find the signature of the error.

Scripts (using the pcitool) are used for the camera initialization, camera control, and for the main data acquisition. GUI can be used for data visualization in real time. GUI can also be used for data acquisition, but in such case, the maximum
frame rate is no more than 20 frames/s.
